## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
In this challenge, I had successfully import the `scss` files into `App.js` by using `npm install sass`. After import there is not necessary to compile the scss to css, when execute `npm start` the scss changes will be reflect immediately.

But there is some issue to the image path (`background-image: url('./path')`) that included in scss. Based on the `Create React App` documentation, images is encourage to stored in `public` folder, but `App.js` that placed in `src` folder failed to resolve the images if is outside of the `src` folder. 

The quick fixed that I did for now is moving the images files over to `src` folder. This is one of the method that some of the developers mentioned in the github issue below. ðŸ‘‡

### Continued development
In my next challenge, I would like to try on using `Style Component` in react to style my CSS in JS.
